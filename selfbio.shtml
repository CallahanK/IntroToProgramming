				<h2>Self Bio</h2>
				<p>I'm Kevin Callahan and a second year computer science major, with a concentration in game design and a minor in mathematics. I had a semester of VB, though to be honest I spent more time playing starcraft than coding. I spent the following two years learning Java. Over those two year, I coded solo projects of varying sizes, a few team built projects, and created a database to manage the math departmentâ€™s textbooks. I also have limited knowledge in the creation of GUIs. </p>
	
				<p>I am a self-described nerd and have embraced that title. I am an avid fan of books, movies, tv, video games, board games, really anything that I can really get into. My all time favorite book and author combination is Douglas Adams and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. When it comes to movies, I know it is a cop out, but I can never pick a favorite. Community, Firefly, and Sherlock are only a few of my top tv shows. I trained in combination style of martial arts to the rank of brown belt for over six years. The style was a combination of jiu jitsu, kempo, and shaolin kung fu. </p>
